# Google Books API Project

## Project
- Create an application that allows you to use the Google Books API to search for books
  - Type in a query and display a list of books matching that query.
  - Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing company, as well as a picture of the book.
  - From each list item, you should also be able to navigate to more information about the book, but this information does not necessarily need to appear on a page within your application. In other words, this could link out to an external site with more information about that particular book.
- Deploy it somewhere that can be accessible through a web browser


## Stack
This app was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), SASS (style pre-processor), Jest/Enzyme (testing library), and axios (making API calls).
